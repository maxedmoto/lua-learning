## Lesson 7 - for loops


-- Enemy spawn | for loops

enemyHP = 30
enemies = 3
totalEnemies = 0

function spawnEnemy()
  for i = 1, enemies do                                                   -- i starts at 1 stops at 3 (because enemies is set to 3)
    newEnemy = enemyHP * i                                                -- for every loop until 3rd reached | newEnemy gets increased by 30 (newEnemy = 30 * i) i increases by 1 until 3 | 30/60/90
    print("Enemy #" .. i .. " spawned with " .. newEnemy .. " HP")        -- prints Enemy #1/2/3 spawned with 30/60/90 HP
  end
  print(enemies .. " enemies has spawned!")                               -- when for loop ends it prints | 3 enemies has spawned
end


spawnEnemy()                                                              -- Calls our function
