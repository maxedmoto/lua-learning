Some things to note about Strings specifically in Lua:

Strings cannot be modified once created
player = "princess peach"
print(player) -- Output: princess peach

Can be written in both single ' ' or double " " quotes
display_message = 'GO TEAM, GO!'
display_message2 = "Oh... Try again team."

Strings can be multi-line with [[ ]]
starting_sequence = [[
Mira, Rumi, and Zoey 
all looked at each 
other in awe, as they
leaped across the stage...
]]


## String Concatenation
We learned that the comma , notation is used to combine two values together when we print.

dragon = "Vhagar"
print("You are fighting", dragon)

String concatenation brings together strings and variables into one string.

In Lua, we use two periods .. to concatenate strings:

name = "Player"
display_message = "Hello, " .. name

print(display_message)  
-- Output: Hello, Player

Both , and the .. are ways to combine strings and variables but we use .. for concatenating strings, and a comma , to print multiple values with spacing.

Lua will automatically convert numbers to strings, but only in print(). In other contexts you'll get an error.

-- this code will ERROR: 
rupees = 4439
bonus = 100 

result = rupees .. bonus 

Since neither variables are strings, Lua won't know how to convert them.
