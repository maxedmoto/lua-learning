## Lesson 7 - for loops

# For Loops
A for loop in Lua is used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times, perfect for things like looping through levels, counting scores, and creating enemies.

Let's take a look at the syntax for a for loop in Lua.


#EXAMPLE

```lua
for i = start, end, step do
    -- code block
end

i is the control variable.

In Lua, you start with index 1, not 0 like in other languages!

start is the starting value of that variable.

end is the ending value of that variable (inclusively).

step is the increment (or decrement using -) value for i in each iteration.
This is optional; if omitted, the default step is 1.

Lua uses 1-based indexing!
