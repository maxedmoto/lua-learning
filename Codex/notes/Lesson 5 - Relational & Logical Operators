## Lesson 5 

# Relational Operators
Lua provides the following relational operators:

--   < less than
--   > greater than
--   <= less than or equal to
--   >= greater than or equal to
--   == equal to (equality)
--   ~= not equal to (the negation of equality)
--   It's important to note that "0" == 0 would be false since "0" evaluates to a string and 0 evaluates to an integer. "0" == "0" would be true.





# Logical Operators
The logical operators are and, or, and not. We can use them in an endless amount of ways when creating a game.


isAlive = true
hasAmmo = false

if isAlive and hasAmmo then
  print("You can shoot!")
else
  print("Cannot fire.")
end

The not operator inverts a boolean, and only works on one value at a time. We can use not to negate state for gameplay, such as the example below.

paused = false

if not paused then
  print("Game is running")
end

We can also add parentheses to our if statements in order to have even more control over the boolean result.

if isAlive and (hasKey or knowsPassword) then
  print("Access Granted!")
else
  print("Access Denied!")
end
